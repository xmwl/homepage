              <h6>Product Designer (July 2016 - Present)</h6>
              <p>I joined as Raise in July 2015 as a Product Designer when Raise acquired Tastebud Technologies. My current work is on Raise’s iOS app, Android app, and <a href="https://www.raise.com/">Raise.com</a>. My role is focused on feature enhancements, product iteration, and maintaining the Raise style throughout its consumer-facing products.</p>

                <h6>Product, Design, Prototyping</h6>
                <p>One of the bigger projects at Raise was updating the design for the wallet redemption screens in both the iOS and Android apps. Serving as the way for customers to use their gift cards in-store, the screen is unique in that is serves two types of customers, Raise users and the cashiers that are redeeming gift cards.</p> 
                <p>Working with the UX team to get user feedback and testing, I used the feedback from customers and cashiers to create a simpler, easier to read, and better branded wallet redemption screen. I went multiple iterations on designs and prototypes to arrive at the current design.</p>

                <p>I led the design for the version 3.0 overhaul of the NEX Outlets iOS app.</p> 
                <p>The goal of the project was to create a coherent experience that fit within the iOS ecosystem and met the business objectives of Tastebud and NEX Outlets.</p>
                <p>I worked with two mobile engineers and a product manager to successfully redesign the app (both visually and on the backend) in addition to creating a new Rewards Program for the mall within the app.</p>

              <p>As a dual French and American citizen, and someone whose identity is firmly split between the two countries, my support for the French national football has never wavered. I always want to know the latest score, but never want to have to fumble around in a larger sports app to find the simple score I need. The result: the Did France Win? app.</p>
              <p>I used the project as starting point to teach myself Swift. While I’m familiar with Xcode and have made design tweaks in code and Interface Builder in the past, I never truly built my own app from scratch until now.</p>
              <p>The app is available now in the App Store and I hope to continually update it in preparation for the European Championships coming this summer. 🏆</p>
