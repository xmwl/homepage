              <h6>Product Designer (July 2015 - August 2016)</h6>
              <p>I joined Raise in July 2015 as a Product Designer when Raise acquired Tastebud Technologies. My work was on Raise’s iOS app, Android app, and <a href="https://www.raise.com/">Raise.com</a>. My role focused on feature enhancements, product iteration, and maintaining the Raise style throughout its consumer-facing products.</p>

                <h6>Product, Design, Prototyping</h6>
                <p>The old merchant pages in the Raise iOS and Android app presented many challenges in the buy flow process for a customer. The main problems to solve with the new design for the merchant page were around the organization of merchant information on the page and issues of space, in particular, on smaller screen sizes.</p>
                <p>I focused on updating the merchant specific section on the top-half of screen, allowing the merchant information to be hidden when scrolling through a list of available cards.</p>

                <p>The goal of this project was to create a wallet redemption design that allowed Raise customers to better understand and manage their gift cards, while also creating an improved experience for cashiers redeeming gift cards bought from Raise.</p> 
                <p>I led the design for the new wallet redemption and worked with the UX team to get real feedback to drive the design process.</p>
                <p>The wallet redemption design featured better branding for each individual brand, easier to read card information, a new way to isolate the most important card information when checking out.</p>

                <h6>Product, Design, Prototyping</h6>
                <p>I led the design efforts to move the Raise iOS app from a hamburger menu to a tabbed navigation. I worked with the engineers and mobile PM to determine the focus of app and which features needed to be placed within the tab navigation.</p>
                <p>I was responsible for designing the new More section and updating any previous interactions within the app that conflicted with the new tab navigation. I also created a prototype of the new app for user testing.</p>

                <p>The goal of this project was to update the design of the sell flow within the app so that it matched the improved styles and standards of the rest of the app.</p>

                <p>I was responsible for designing the modal and ensuring that it fit the requirements of our Zendesk integration so that comments made in the Rate the app modal were properly received by the Raise Customer Service team.</p>

              <p>As a dual French and American citizen, and someone whose identity is firmly split between the two countries, my support for the French national football has never wavered. I always want to know the latest score, but never want to have to fumble around in a larger sports app to find the simple score I need. The result: the Did France Win? app.</p>
              <p>I used the project as starting point to teach myself Swift. While I’m familiar with Xcode and have made design tweaks in code and Interface Builder in the past, I never truly built my own app from scratch until now.</p>
              <p>The app is available now in the App Store.</p>

              <p>A Spot in the City is a collection of city guides to New York City, London, and Chicago that I’ve been putting together for last couple years. I needed a central place to link to the guides and created a website to do just that.</p>
