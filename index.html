            <strong>What's new?</strong>
            <p>As part of the NEX Rewards project, I worked with the mobile team at Tastebud to create a phone authentication flow for the NEX app on iOS and Android. Deciding to forego the creation of email and password user account in favor of phone authentication allowed us to create an experience for our users that was both simple and secure.</p> 
            <p>I helped with designing the UX flow for the authentication and the UI screens for both platforms</p>
            <p>We used <a href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a> as part of the authentication process.</p>

            <strong>What's new?</strong>
            <p>For the 3.0 version of the Nebraska Crossing Outlets iOS app we decided to overhaul the work. Part of this was a full redesign and backend overhaul of the app.</p>
            <strong>What problem are you solving?</strong>
            <p>As the product designer, it was my job to determine what part of the old design needed to be changed and what could stay the same. I worked with our product manager to determine the scope of the project and incorporate the new designs into the app.</p>
            <p>The goal for me was to create a coherent experience with the application and the overall iOS platform. We weren't going to create an all-in-one app for both iOS and Android, we knew we needed separate apps with different designs.</p>
            <p>For iOS, I changed the navigation to follow Apple standards and overhauled the offer feed in the app and designed a filter for brands.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="one-third column">
            <strong>What did you do?</strong>
            <p>I was involved with the design process from the start. From basic competitive analysis and UX wireframing to UI design, prototyping, and QA. I worked regularly with our amazing iOS engineer, giving and receiving feedback on the design and it's implementation within the app.</p>
            <strong>What were some challenges during the initial design process?</strong>
            <p>One challenge was managing the new range of device sizes! The project for the new iOS app came after the release of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, so this was the first time we would be building for larger iPhones.</p>
            <p>Designing the new offer feed was difficult, but I'm happy with the result. It was tough finding a way to balance the displaying of content in the feed. We had to find a way to fit multiple parameters into each offer tile. This becomes especially difficult with stores logos, which also seems to be come in every size and ratio imaginable.</p>
            <strong>What was your favorite part of the app?</strong>
            <p>The offer feed (see above).</p>

            <strong>What's new?</strong>
            <p>I was in charge of designing the first native build of the Android app. I made the decision to create the app using Google's new Material Design.</p>
            <strong>What problem are you solving?</strong>
            <p>Creating a design that improves the functionality, ease of use, and seamlessly integrates into the Android ecosystem.</p>
            <strong>What did you do?</strong>
            <p>I was involved with the design process from the start. From basic competitive analysis and UX wireframing to UI design, prototyping, and QA. I was lucky to work with an amazing Android engineer who provided valuable feedback throughout the build.</p>
            <strong>What were some challenges during the initial design process?</strong>
            <p>One of the important early decisions I had to make was concerning the app navigation, centered around hamburger menus. While Google makes the point within their guidelines that apps aren't necessarily required to have them as the principal method of navigating, Google still uses one in most of their Material Design examples and mockups.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="one-third column">
            <p>Ultimately, I decided against the hamburger bar from both a design and business objective standpoint. Often times, hamburger bars become a sort of trash bin for navigation items and luckily for us the NEX app is fairly simple in terms of its functionality. This allowed us to use a more straight forward and easier to use tab navigation (done in a more Android style of course!).</p>
            <p>Another challenge was managing the difficulties in implementing Material Design items like rounded cards on pre-Lollipop devices.</p>
            <strong>What was your favorite part of the app?</strong>
            <p>This was my first foray into Material Design and I quickly learned to love it. There's just something about the combination of colors, animation, and flow that's fantastic. One specific area I particularly love is the Mall Info section (see images below). Having a layered angled bar (modeled after Google Maps) is different and striking compared to the rest of the app. Dave, our Android engineer, did an incredible job in building it in the app, it's super smooth and works like a charm!</p>
